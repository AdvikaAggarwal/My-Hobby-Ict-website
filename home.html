       but sadly, swimming pool in my society was closed due to covid for 2 years. But since April'22, the swimming pool is opened and after a long time, I went swimming again ! </dd>

    <dd class="infor">I did not have much interest but over time I read some good novels by some famous authors and developed an interest for reading. I read books authored by - Roald Dhal, David Williams, Jeff Kiney and Martyn Ford. But I got a crazy addiction for one of the most book series - Harry Porter written by J K Rowling. I also have an interest of reading small biographies. </dd>

    <span><img src="cooking.jpg" class="imag"></span><span><img src="baking.jpg" class="imag"></span>
    <dd class="infor">Everybody who knows me know that I am a foodie and I have a sweet tooth. Since, I like eating tasty food, I developed an interest for cooking and baking. I observed how my mom cooked various food items (what spices and herbs she added and what was the process to cook the food and then I started to help her out in the kitchen.) I also started watching baking videos on the internet and started making tasty cakes and cupcakeswith my mom.(like biscuit cakes, I also made an orange cake for fathers day and chocolate muffins.)</dd>

    <dt id="five">Exercising</dt>
    <img src="exercise.jpg" class="imag">
    <dd class="infor">I today's lifestyle and the amount of junk food we have, its very important to stay fit and healthy. Before covid, I used to play for hours with my friends in the park so I got my exercis there. But during covid as I couldn't leave the house I got no exercise so my parents decided to get a tredmill to help me stay fit. I used to run on the treadmill daily for 20 to 30 minutes. Along with exercising, its very important to have a control on our diet, we should have limited junk food and keep exercising regularly but we can have a cheat day once in 15 days.  </dd>
